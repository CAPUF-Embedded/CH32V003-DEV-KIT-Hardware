# What comes along with the CH32V003 Dev Kit?
CH32V003 Dev Kit comes with the following:

- CH32V003 Dev Kit Development Board
- USB-A to USB-C Cable
- WCHLinkE Programmer

**NOTE**: The package includes the above so the developer can fully evaluate CH32V003 MCU without buying anything else.

# How do you start learning MCU Programming?
A Complete CH32V003 Programming Tutorial is available [here](https://pallavaggarwal.in/2023/10/01/ch32v003-low-cost-mcu-programming/). This is still a work in progress (WIP), so more tutorials will be published soon.
